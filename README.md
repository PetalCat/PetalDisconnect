PetalDisconnect

PetalDisconnect is a lightweight client-side utility mod that gives you full control over how and when you disconnect from Minecraft servers.
Whether you need an instant panic key, automatic disconnects when the game loses focus, or optional smart auto-reconnect behavior, this mod keeps you safe, fast, and in control.

✨ Features

🔌 Quick Disconnect Keybind

Instantly drop your server connection using a dedicated keybind.
Perfect for panic exits, privacy, or quickly switching tasks.

🪟 Auto-Disconnect on Lost Focus

Optionally disconnects you the moment your game window loses focus.
Ideal for players who multitask, alt-tab frequently, or want to ensure nothing happens while they’re away.

🔄 Optional Auto-Reconnect

If enabled, the mod can automatically reconnect when you refocus the game only if the mod itself caused the disconnect.
Normal disconnects (server kicks, manual leaves) will never trigger an unwanted reconnect.

⚙️ In-Game Settings Menu

Accessible through Mod Menu, offering clean toggles for:
	•	Enable Quick Disconnect
	•	Disconnect on Focus Loss
	•	Auto Reconnect

🧪 How It Works

PetalDisconnect listens for:
	•	Window focus changes
	•	Client disconnect events
	•	Your quick-disconnect keybind

It then decides intelligently whether it should disconnect or reconnect depending on:
	•	Your configuration
	•	Whether the mod triggered the disconnect
	•	Whether a valid server entry is available

⸻

🔧 Configuration

You can configure mod options through:
	•	Mod Menu → PetalDisconnect → Configure
	•	or via .minecraft/config/petaldisconnect.json
